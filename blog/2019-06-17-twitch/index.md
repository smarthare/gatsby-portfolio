So last week I decided on finally streaming. I was thinking about doing it for quite awhile and I ended up just giving it a shot. I gave an introduction to Gatsby as I am planning on using it for various projects on stream as well as an intro to my [Gatsby-github-stats dashboard site](https://gatsby-github-stats.netlify.com/).

If you are interested in tuning in, I stream at this time every Wednesday on Twitch at [twitch.tv/lannonbr](https://twitch.tv/lannonbr/):

- 1PM PT
- 4PM ET
- 10PM CEST

I am planning on sharing a link to the Stream notes by at least the next upcoming stream in two days.
