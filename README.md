# Lannonbr.com

This is the git repository for the source of lannonbr.com, the personal website of myself, Benjamin Lannon.

The site is developed in Gatsby.

## What's involved

* Data sourced from GitHub using their v4 GraphQL API
* Data from Prismic CMS

Auth tokens for both are required to load in everything correctly.

Other tools used include:

* Styled-components
* Moment
* React-feather

## Other Tidbits

The site is deployed on Netlify. Either any time a commit is pushed to the `master` branch or at 12am every day, the site will be rebuilt and redeployed.
