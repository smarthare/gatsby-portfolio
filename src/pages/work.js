    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently employed as a web developer, but I am always wanting to
      learn new technologies and ways to build new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to see the hardware / software I use, head over to my{' '}
      <Link to="/uses/">Uses Page</Link>.
    </p>
    <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
    <p>
      I am an active member of the Syracuse Developer community and go to events
      such as Open Hack or the Syracue JS meetup. You can find out more at{' '}
      <a href="https://syracuse.io">Syracuse.io</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well, I am heavily active on GitHub. If you want to learn more about my
      open source work, head over to the{' '}
      <Link to="opensource">Open Source Page</Link> or my{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/lannonbr">Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I've found a haven inÂ the Twitch Dev community of individuals
      livestreaming and learning with others. You may often see me in the chats
      of <a href="https://twitch.tv/noopkat">Suz Hinton</a>,{' '}
      <a href="https://twitch.tv/clarkio">Brian Clark</a>,{' '}
      <a href="https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz">Jeff Fritz</a>, and plenty of
      others.
